FULL MOON DATES CSV

Download the CSV from the lesson's Resources section, or download it from the following
S3 location:
https://dbtlearn.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seed_full_moon_dates.csv

Then place it to the seeds folder
If you download from S3 on a Mac/Linux, can you import the csv straight to your seed folder
by executing this command:


CONTENTS OF MODELS/MART/FULL_MOON_REVIEWS.SQL

{{ config(materialized = 'table',) }}

full_moon_dates AS (
 SELECT * FROM {{ ref('seed_full_moon_dates') }}
)
SELECT r.* , CASE
 WHEN fm.full_moon_date IS NULL THEN 'not full moon'
 ELSE 'full moon'
 END AS is_full_moon
FROM
 fct_reviews
 r
 LEFT JOIN full_moon_dates
 fm
 ON (TO_DATE(r.review_date) = DATEADD(DAY, 1, fm.full_moon_date)
